# 🎯 Learn Dart
This is a repository for keeping track of my learning progress of Dart programming language.

## 📘 What is Dart?

[Dart](https://dart.dev) is a **client-optimized** programming language developed by Google, designed for building fast, modern apps across **mobile**, **web**, **desktop**, and **backend** environments. Dart is best known as the language behind the Flutter framework, used to build beautiful cross-platform apps.

## 🧠 Dart Paradigms

Dart supports multiple programming paradigms, making it flexible and powerful:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Everything is an object, even numbers and functions.
- **Functional Programming Features:** First-class functions, closures, and higher-order functions.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** `Future`, `async/await`, and `Stream` support make Dart ideal for I/O operations.
- **Strongly Typed Language:** With optional type inference using `var` and `final`.
